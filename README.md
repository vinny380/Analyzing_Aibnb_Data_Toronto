[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com.br/) is considered to be the **biggest hotel franchise in the world**, the interesting part about it is that **they have no hotels at all!**

Through an innovative way of finding accommodation, Airbnb connects people who want to travel (and to accommodate somewhere) to house hosts who want to rent their places.

After 10 years of its foundation in 2008, by the end of 2018 Airbnb had already **hosted over 300 million people** all around the world, challeging traditional hotel brands to reinvent themselves.



The Startup also has a culture of handling **free data** in the internet. Through the website [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) you can download data from **some of the biggest cities in the world**, which allows you to build countless projects and *Data Science* solutions.

Data science is the best way to take insights from pieces that seem useless.

**In this notebook we will analyze the given data about Toronto, and then will see which insights can be taken from it**.
